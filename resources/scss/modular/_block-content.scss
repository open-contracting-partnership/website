			<p>There is increasing evidence that open contracting delivers.</p>
			<p>Academic research shows that improved openness and transparency is good for public integrity, value for money and competition. A study of more than 3.5 million government contracts across Europe determined that every additional item of information shared about a tender decreases the risk of a single bid contract. This matters because single bid contracts are both a governance risk and over 7% more expensive than the norm. Publishing five more pieces of information about each contract in Europe would add up to 3.6 billion Euros in savings.</p>
			<p>Results from countries that are implementing open contracting show that openness combined with monitoring works. In Peru, a study from Columbia University looked at the impact of transparency and monitoring of contracts on the procurement process of infrastructure projects and found that monitoring decreased spending by 50%. Similar results have been found in Afghanistan.</p>
